not really sure what i'm doing here. kind of to be expected with massive architectural shift, but a little bit upsetting to see 
a fair bit of work get thrown out the window. whatever.

What I know right now:

I need to find similar detection products, gas leak instead of air leak.

Find out what they use for compute.

Compare to what I know is like theoretically possible / makes sense to me

Current really rough idea:

STM based chip (this might be subject to change if too expensive)
Battery has to be single use and last three years under load (gives me a slight buffer for 2 year guarantee)
PDM data processed on or off chip (might even change sensor im using)
LTE chip will only go on mother node as they are so fucking costly (node will be plugged into outlet)
wireless communication is going to have to shift from espnow :/
